This is an end-to-end data science project designed to analyze Canadian job postings while recommending best-matching roles for candidates. Data was scraped from the Canada Job Bank using Selenium, then cleaned, wrangled, and enriched through feature engineering and topic modeling of job titles.

Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) provided insights into data patterns and distributions. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and detecting and treating outliers to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling.

A range of supervised learning algorithms—Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ridge Regression, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM—were developed and evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the highest prediction accuracy. Model optimization involved analyzing feature importance, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and performing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most influential features.

Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were integrated to recommend the most relevant job postings to candidates based on their profiles, combining structured data and text analysis for personalized recommendations.

This project demonstrates the application of modern machine learning and NLP workflows to create intelligent tools that bring practical value to job seekers and hiring platforms alike.
